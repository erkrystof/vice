# vice
VICE imported from SVN, optionally patches from my custom circuit work.

Patches I overlay on top of VICE for circuit work...

The HEAD of this repo is generally a version of VICE as imported from SVN.


Currently that's 3.5.


See the [releases](https://github.com/erkrystof/vice/releases) for the various versions.

For more information as to why I created these patches, check out the series:

# install scripts
In the root of this project I have install scripts that install VICE on a raspberry PI from the SVN sources.  They're used as reference.  If a script installs from my github copy, it will be noted in the script filename itself.
